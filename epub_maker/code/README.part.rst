PURPOSE
-------

rebookmaker - an open source (MIT-licensed) re-implementation of
Marcelo Liraâ€™s ( @setanata ) ebookmaker.

It converts an EPUB definition inside a JSON file along with
some input HTML and image files into an .epub.

See:

* https://github.com/setanta/ebookmaker/ - does not have an explicit
licence, which prompted this re-implementation.

* https://pypi.org/project/ebookmaker/ - GPLv3 by Project Gutenberg and
incompatible with @setanata 's .
The black_hole_solver PyPI distribution wraps the Black Hole Solitaire
Solver C API:

INSTALLATION
